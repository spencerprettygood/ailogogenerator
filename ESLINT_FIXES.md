# ESLint Error Resolution Plan

This document outlines the approach to systematically fix the ESLint errors in the codebase.

## Error Categories

The ESLint errors can be categorized as follows:

1. **Unused Variables and Imports** (most common)
   - Example: `'_' is defined but never used`

2. **TypeScript `any` Usage** 
   - Example: `Unexpected any. Specify a different type`

3. **React Hooks Rules Violations**
   - Example: `React Hook "React.useId" is called conditionally`

4. **TS-Ignore and TS-Comment Issues**
   - Example: `Use "@ts-expect-error" instead of "@ts-ignore"`

5. **Next.js Specific Issues**
   - Example: `Do not use <head> element. Use <Head /> from next/head instead`

6. **Import Style Issues**
   - Example: `A require() style import is forbidden`

## Resolution Strategy

For each category of issues, we'll apply a consistent fix strategy:

### 1. Unused Variables and Imports

- **For props**: Examine if the prop is truly unused or if it's a placeholder for future implementation
- **For imports**: Remove if truly unused, or if needed for types only, convert to type imports
- **For internal variables**: Either remove or comment explaining why it's declared but unused

### 2. TypeScript `any` Usage

- Replace with proper types where possible
- For complex types, create proper interfaces
- If truly dynamic, use `unknown` instead of `any` and add proper type guards

### 3. React Hooks Rules

- Ensure hooks are always called at the top level
- Never call hooks conditionally
- Move conditional logic inside the hook when needed

### 4. TS-Ignore Issues

- Replace `@ts-ignore` with `@ts-expect-error` with comments
- Better yet, fix the underlying type issue instead of suppressing the error

### 5. Next.js Specific Issues

- Follow Next.js best practices for app directory
- Replace deprecated patterns with recommended alternatives

### 6. Import Style Issues

- Convert `require()` style imports to ES module imports
- Use consistent import patterns across the codebase

## File-by-File Resolution

We'll apply these fixes in the following order:

1. First, fix the scripts and configuration files
2. Next, fix the core library files
3. Then, fix components
4. Finally, fix API routes

This ensures that the foundational code is fixed first, making it easier to address issues in dependent components.

## Documentation Updates

For each significant pattern change, we'll update documentation to explain:
- The new pattern to follow
- Why the change was necessary
- How to ensure the pattern is followed in future code

## Testing Strategy

After each set of fixes:
1. Run the linter to verify errors are resolved
2. Run the build to ensure compilation succeeds
3. Run tests to verify functionality is preserved
4. Manually verify critical features

## Implementation Tracking

As we resolve issues, we'll track progress in a table:

| File | Issues | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| lib/utils/logger.ts | 7 ESLint errors | Pending | Contains 5 any types and module assignment issue |

This structured approach ensures we systematically address all issues while maintaining functionality.
