  - Suboptimal environment variable handling
  - Client/server boundary issues

- **Solutions Implemented:**
  - Updated layout to be a server component
  - Added proper metadata exports with viewport configuration
  - Created client-side wrapper for ThemeProvider
  - Improved environment variable handling

### 5. Production Code Quality

- **Issues Found:**

  - Console logging statements throughout codebase
  - Debug code in production components
  - Inefficient error handling approaches
  - Development-only code paths

- **Solutions Implemented:**
  - Replaced console.log statements with structured logging
  - Updated claude-service.ts to use proper logging
  - Improved error handling with better type safety
  - Optimized animation showcase preview generation

### 6. Type Safety & TypeScript Compliance

- **Issues Found:**

  - Excessive use of 'any' type
  - Unsafe type assertions
  - Inconsistent type definitions across components
  - Missing or incomplete interfaces

- **Solutions Implemented:**
  - Identified key areas for type safety improvements
  - Fixed critical type issues in animation components
  - Documented type compliance issues for further work
