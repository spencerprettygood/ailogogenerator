# OpenTelemetry Blocker Patch Removal

This project previously included a file at `lib/opentelemetry-blocker.js` as a workaround for legacy Next.js or OpenTelemetry issues. This is no longer needed with Next.js 15+ and modern observability tooling.

**Action:**
- Delete `/lib/opentelemetry-blocker.js` and any similar patch files.
- Remove all references to these files in configs, scripts, and documentation.
- Do not reintroduce these files. If you encounter OpenTelemetry issues, address them with supported Next.js 15+ solutions.
