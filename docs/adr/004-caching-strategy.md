# Architecture Decision Record: Caching Strategy

## Status

## Context
The AI Logo Generator performs complex and resource-intensive operations, including multiple API calls to Claude, SVG generation, validation, and transformation. These operations are:

1. **Computationally expensive** - Generating logos requires significant AI resources
2. **Time-consuming** - A full generation can take 1-3 minutes
3. **Costly** - Each generation incurs Claude API token costs

Additionally, users may frequently generate similar or identical logos, such as:
- Trying slightly different prompts for the same brand
- Generating the same logo in multiple sessions
- Collaborating with team members on the same brand

Without caching, each logo generation would require a full pipeline execution, leading to:
- Poor user experience due to long wait times
- Increased infrastructure costs from redundant AI API calls
- Unnecessary resource consumption

## Decision
We decided to implement a comprehensive multi-level caching strategy with the following components:

1. **Cache Manager** - A singleton service to handle all caching operations
   - In-memory caching for rapid access
   - Configurable TTL (Time To Live) for different cache types
   - Cache size limits with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
   - Support for complete and partial results

2. **Cache Types**
   - **Generation Cache** - Complete logo generation results
   - **Intermediate Cache** - Results from individual pipeline stages
   - **Progress Cache** - Generation progress information
   - **Asset Cache** - Generated assets like SVGs and PNGs

3. **Caching Points**
   - At the API route level - For complete generation results
   - Within the multi-agent orchestrator - For intermediate results
   - In the streaming system - For progress information

4. **Cache Key Generation**
   - Deterministic hashing of logo briefs and parameters
   - Content-based keys that identify functionally equivalent requests

5. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Time-based expiration with different TTLs per cache type
   - Size-based eviction when cache limits are reached
   - Manual invalidation capabilities for specific items or types

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Improved Performance** - Near-instant logo generation for cached requests
2. **Cost Reduction** - Significantly reduced API calls and token usage
3. **Enhanced User Experience** - Faster results and improved responsiveness
4. **Resource Efficiency** - Better utilization of computational resources
5. **Resilience** - Reduced dependency on external API availability

### Negative
1. **Increased Complexity** - More sophisticated code and potential for bugs
2. **Memory Usage** - Additional server memory consumption for cache storage
3. **Cache Invalidation Challenges** - Potential for stale or incorrect results
4. **Development Overhead** - More components to maintain and test

### Neutral
1. **Configurability** - Can be enabled/disabled and tuned as needed
2. **Transparency** - Cache hits/misses are communicated to the client

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No Caching** - Simple but inefficient and costly
2. **External Cache Service** (Redis, Memcached) - More robust but adds dependencies
3. **File-based Caching** - Persistent but slower than in-memory
4. **Database Caching** - Persistent and queryable but higher overhead
5. **CDN-based Caching** - Good for assets but not suitable for personalized content

## Implementation Details

1. **CacheManager Class**
   - Singleton pattern for global access
   - Methods for different cache operations
   - Cache key generation via cryptographic hashing
   - Configurable TTLs and size limits

2. **API Route Integration**
   - Check cache before initiating generation
   - Store results in cache after successful generation
   - Stream cache status to clients

3. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator Enhancement**
   - Cache intermediate results per stage
   - Use cached results to skip completed stages
   - Apply fallbacks using cached results when appropriate

4. **Client-Side Handling**
   - UI indication of cached results
   - Hooks for handling cache events
   - Options to bypass cache when needed

## Future Considerations

1. **Persistent Caching** - Adding Redis or database backend for persistence
2. **Distributed Caching** - Supporting multi-server environments
3. **Cache Analytics** - Tracking hit rates and optimization opportunities
4. **Smart Prefetching** - Anticipating user needs based on patterns
5. **Cache Compression** - Reducing memory footprint for large results
6. **Cache Versioning** - Handling changes in output format or quality
