## NEXT.JS DOCUMENTATION TO NOTE
# Next.js on Vercel

Edge Runtime
Next.js has two server runtimes you can use in your application:

The Node.js Runtime (default), which has access to all Node.js APIs and is used for rendering your application.
The Edge Runtime which contains a more limited set of APIs, used in Middleware.
Caveats
The Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs. Some packages may not work as expected.
The Edge Runtime does not support Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
Both runtimes can support streaming depending on your deployment adapter.

Unsupported APIs
The Edge Runtime has some restrictions including:

Native Node.js APIs are not supported. For example, you can't read or write to the filesystem.
node_modules can be used, as long as they implement ES Modules and do not use native Node.js APIs.
Calling require directly is not allowed. Use ES Modules instead.
The following JavaScript language features are disabled, and will not work:

API	Description
eval	Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string
new Function(evalString)	Creates a new function with the code provided as an argument
WebAssembly.compile	Compiles a WebAssembly module from a buffer source
WebAssembly.instantiate	Compiles and instantiates a WebAssembly module from a buffer source
In rare cases, your code could contain (or import) some dynamic code evaluation statements which can not be reached at runtime and which can not be removed by treeshaking. You can relax the check to allow specific files with your Middleware configuration:

middleware.ts

export const config = {
  unstable_allowDynamic: [
    // allows a single file
    '/lib/utilities.js',
    // use a glob to allow anything in the function-bind 3rd party module
    '**/node_modules/function-bind/**',
  ],
}
unstable_allowDynamic is a glob, or an array of globs, ignoring dynamic code evaluation for specific files. The globs are relative to your application root folder.

Be warned that if these statements are executed on the Edge, they will throw and cause a runtime error.
Create a Route Handler
As long as you are on Next.js 13+, you can use Route Handlers (using the App Router) alongside the Pages Router. This is recommended to enable you to use the Web APIs interface/signature and to better support streaming.

Create a Route Handler (app/api/chat/route.ts) and add the following code:

app/api/chat/route.ts

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

Define an asynchronous POST request handler and extract messages from the body of the request. The messages variable contains a history of the conversation between you and the chatbot and provides the chatbot with the necessary context to make the next generation.
Call streamText, which is imported from the ai package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a model provider (imported from @ai-sdk/openai) and messages (defined in step 1). You can pass additional settings to further customise the model's behaviour.
The streamText function returns a StreamTextResult. This result object contains the toDataStreamResponse function which converts the result to a streamed response object.
Finally, return the result to the client to stream the response.
This Route Handler creates a POST request endpoint at /api/chat.

Wire up the UI
Now that you have an API route that can query an LLM, it's time to setup your frontend. The AI SDK's UI package abstract the complexity of a chat interface into one hook, useChat.

Update your root page (pages/index.tsx) with the following code to show a list of chat messages and provide a user message input:

pages/index.tsx

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, i) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>{part.text}</div>;
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
This page utilizes the useChat hook, which will, by default, use the POST API route you created earlier (/api/chat). The hook provides functions and state for handling user input and form submission. The useChat hook provides multiple utility functions and state variables:

messages - the current chat messages (an array of objects with id, role, and parts properties).
input - the current value of the user's input field.
handleInputChange and handleSubmit - functions to handle user interactions (typing into the input field and submitting the form, respectively).
The LLM's response is accessed through the message parts array. Each message contains an ordered array of parts that represents everything the model generated in its response. These parts can include plain text, reasoning tokens, and more that you will see later. The parts array preserves the sequence of the model's outputs, allowing you to display or process each component in the order it was generated.

Running Your Application
With that, you have built everything you need for your chatbot! To start your application, use the command:

pnpm run dev
Head to your browser and open http://localhost:3000. You should see an input field. Test it out by entering a message and see the AI chatbot respond in real-time! The AI SDK makes it fast and easy to build AI chat interfaces with Next.js.

Enhance Your Chatbot with Tools
While large language models (LLMs) have incredible generation capabilities, they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather). This is where tools come in.

Tools are actions that an LLM can invoke. The results of these actions can be reported back to the LLM to be considered in the next response.

For example, if a user asks about the current weather, without tools, the model would only be able to provide general information based on its training data. But with a weather tool, it can fetch and provide up-to-date, location-specific weather information.

Let's enhance your chatbot by adding a simple weather tool.

Update Your Route Handler
Modify your app/api/chat/route.ts file to include the new weather tool:

app/api/chat/route.ts

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
    tools: {
      weather: tool({
        description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
        parameters: z.object({
          location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ location }) => {
          const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
          return {
            location,
            temperature,
          };
        },
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
In this updated code:

You import the tool function from the ai package and z from zod for schema validation.

You define a tools object with a weather tool. This tool:

Has a description that helps the model understand when to use it.
Defines parameters using a Zod schema, specifying that it requires a location string to execute this tool. The model will attempt to extract this parameter from the context of the conversation. If it can't, it will ask the user for the missing information.
Defines an execute function that simulates getting weather data (in this case, it returns a random temperature). This is an asynchronous function running on the server so you can fetch real data from an external API.
Now your chatbot can "fetch" weather information for any location the user asks about. When the model determines it needs to use the weather tool, it will generate a tool call with the necessary parameters. The execute function will then be automatically run, and you can access the results via toolInvocations that is available on the message object.

Try asking something like "What's the weather in New York?" and see how the model uses the new tool.

Notice the blank response in the UI? This is because instead of generating a text response, the model generated a tool call. You can access the tool call and subsequent tool result in the toolInvocations key of the message object.

Update the UI
To display the tool invocations in your UI, update your pages/index.tsx file:

pages/index.tsx

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, i) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>{part.text}</div>;
              case 'tool-invocation':
                return (
                  <pre key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>
                    {JSON.stringify(part.toolInvocation, null, 2)}
                  </pre>
                );
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
With this change, you're updating the UI to handle different message parts. For text parts, you display the text content as before. For tool invocations, you display a JSON representation of the tool call and its result.

Now, when you ask about the weather, you'll see the tool invocation and its result displayed in your chat interface.

Enabling Multi-Step Tool Calls
You may have noticed that while the tool results are visible in the chat interface, the model isn't using this information to answer your original query. This is because once the model generates a tool call, it has technically completed its generation.

To solve this, you can enable multi-step tool calls using the maxSteps option in your useChat hook. This feature will automatically send tool results back to the model to trigger an additional generation. In this case, you want the model to answer your question using the results from the weather tool.

Update Your Client-Side Code
Modify your pages/index.tsx file to include the maxSteps option:

pages/index.tsx

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    maxSteps: 5,
  });

  // ... rest of your component code
}
Head back to the browser and ask about the weather in a location. You should now see the model using the weather tool results to answer your question.

By setting maxSteps to 5, you're allowing the model to use up to 5 "steps" for any given generation. This enables more complex interactions and allows the model to gather and process information over several steps if needed. You can see this in action by adding another tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Update Your Route Handler
Update your app/api/chat/route.ts file to add a new tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

app/api/chat/route.ts

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
    tools: {
      weather: tool({
        description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
        parameters: z.object({
          location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ location }) => {
          const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
          return {
            location,
            temperature,
          };
        },
      }),
      convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
        description: 'Convert a temperature in fahrenheit to celsius',
        parameters: z.object({
          temperature: z
            .number()
            .describe('The temperature in fahrenheit to convert'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
          const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
          return {
            celsius,
          };
        },
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
Now, when you ask "What's the weather in New York in celsius?", you should see a more complete interaction:

The model will call the weather tool for New York.
You'll see the tool result displayed.
It will then call the temperature conversion tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The model will then use that information to provide a natural language response about the weather in New York.
This multi-step approach allows the model to gather information and use it to provide more accurate and contextual responses, making your chatbot considerably more useful.

This simple example demonstrates how tools can expand your model's capabilities. You can create more complex tools to integrate with real APIs, databases, or any other external systems, allowing the model to access and process real-world data in real-time. Tools bridge the gap between the model's knowledge cutoff and current information.

Where to Next?
You've built an AI chatbot using the AI SDK! From here, you have several paths to explore:

To learn more about the AI SDK, read through the documentation.
If you're interested in diving deeper with guides, check out the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and multi-modal chatbot guides.
To jumpstart your first AI project, explore available templates.


Getting Started
Next.js App Router
Next.js App Router Quickstart
In this quick start tutorial, you'll build a simple AI-chatbot with a streaming user interface. Along the way, you'll learn key concepts and techniques that are fundamental to using the SDK in your own projects.

Check out Prompt Engineering and HTTP Streaming if you haven't heard of them.

Prerequisites
To follow this quickstart, you'll need:

Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.
An OpenAI API key.
If you haven't obtained your OpenAI API key, you can do so by signing up on the OpenAI website.

Create Your Application
Start by creating a new Next.js application. This command will create a new directory named my-ai-app and set up a basic Next.js application inside it.

Be sure to select yes when prompted to use the App Router and Tailwind CSS. If you are looking for the Next.js Pages Router quickstart guide, you can find it here.

pnpm create next-app@latest my-ai-app
Navigate to the newly created directory:

cd my-ai-app
Install dependencies
Install ai, @ai-sdk/react, and @ai-sdk/openai, the AI package, AI SDK's React hooks, and AI SDK's OpenAI provider respectively.

The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just one line of code! Learn more about available providers and building custom providers in the providers section.

pnpm
npm
yarn
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai zod
Make sure you are using ai version 3.1 or higher.

Configure OpenAI API key
Create a .env.local file in your project root and add your OpenAI API Key. This key is used to authenticate your application with the OpenAI service.

touch .env.local
Edit the .env.local file:

.env.local

OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
Replace xxxxxxxxx with your actual OpenAI API key.

The AI SDK's OpenAI Provider will default to using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

Create a Route Handler
Create a route handler, app/api/chat/route.ts and add the following code:

app/api/chat/route.ts

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

Define an asynchronous POST request handler and extract messages from the body of the request. The messages variable contains a history of the conversation between you and the chatbot and provides the chatbot with the necessary context to make the next generation.
Call streamText, which is imported from the ai package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a model provider (imported from @ai-sdk/openai) and messages (defined in step 1). You can pass additional settings to further customise the model's behaviour.
The streamText function returns a StreamTextResult. This result object contains the toDataStreamResponse function which converts the result to a streamed response object.
Finally, return the result to the client to stream the response.
This Route Handler creates a POST request endpoint at /api/chat.

Wire up the UI
Now that you have a Route Handler that can query an LLM, it's time to setup your frontend. The AI SDK's UI package abstracts the complexity of a chat interface into one hook, useChat.

Update your root page (app/page.tsx) with the following code to show a list of chat messages and provide a user message input:

app/page.tsx

'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, i) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>{part.text}</div>;
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
Make sure you add the "use client" directive to the top of your file. This allows you to add interactivity with Javascript.

This page utilizes the useChat hook, which will, by default, use the POST API route you created earlier (/api/chat). The hook provides functions and state for handling user input and form submission. The useChat hook provides multiple utility functions and state variables:

messages - the current chat messages (an array of objects with id, role, and parts properties).
input - the current value of the user's input field.
handleInputChange and handleSubmit - functions to handle user interactions (typing into the input field and submitting the form, respectively).
The LLM's response is accessed through the message parts array. Each message contains an ordered array of parts that represents everything the model generated in its response. These parts can include plain text, reasoning tokens, and more that you will see later. The parts array preserves the sequence of the model's outputs, allowing you to display or process each component in the order it was generated.

Running Your Application
With that, you have built everything you need for your chatbot! To start your application, use the command:

pnpm run dev
Head to your browser and open http://localhost:3000. You should see an input field. Test it out by entering a message and see the AI chatbot respond in real-time! The AI SDK makes it fast and easy to build AI chat interfaces with Next.js.

        parameters: z.object({
          location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ location }) => {
          const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
          return {
            location,
            temperature,
          };
        },
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
In this updated code:

You import the tool function from the ai package and z from zod for schema validation.

You define a tools object with a weather tool. This tool:

Has a description that helps the model understand when to use it.
Defines parameters using a Zod schema, specifying that it requires a location string to execute this tool. The model will attempt to extract this parameter from the context of the conversation. If it can't, it will ask the user for the missing information.
Defines an execute function that simulates getting weather data (in this case, it returns a random temperature). This is an asynchronous function running on the server so you can fetch real data from an external API.
Now your chatbot can "fetch" weather information for any location the user asks about. When the model determines it needs to use the weather tool, it will generate a tool call with the necessary parameters. The execute function will then be automatically run, and you can access the results via tool-invocations part that is available on the message.parts array.

Try asking something like "What's the weather in New York?" and see how the model uses the new tool.

Notice the blank response in the UI? This is because instead of generating a text response, the model generated a tool call. You can access the tool call and subsequent tool result via the tool-invocation part of the message.parts array.

Update the UI
To display the tool invocations in your UI, update your app/page.tsx file:

app/page.tsx

'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, i) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>{part.text}</div>;
              case 'tool-invocation':
                return (
                  <pre key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>
                    {JSON.stringify(part.toolInvocation, null, 2)}
                  </pre>
                );
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
With this change, you're updating the UI to handle different message parts. For text parts, you display the text content as before. For tool invocations, you display a JSON representation of the tool call and its result.

Now, when you ask about the weather, you'll see the tool invocation and its result displayed in your chat interface.

Enabling Multi-Step Tool Calls
You may have noticed that while the tool results are visible in the chat interface, the model isn't using this information to answer your original query. This is because once the model generates a tool call, it has technically completed its generation.

To solve this, you can enable multi-step tool calls using the maxSteps option in your useChat hook. This feature will automatically send tool results back to the model to trigger an additional generation. In this case, you want the model to answer your question using the results from the weather tool.

Update Your Client-Side Code
Modify your app/page.tsx file to include the maxSteps option:

app/page.tsx

'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    maxSteps: 5,
  });

  // ... rest of your component code
}
Head back to the browser and ask about the weather in a location. You should now see the model using the weather tool results to answer your question.

By setting maxSteps to 5, you're allowing the model to use up to 5 "steps" for any given generation. This enables more complex interactions and allows the model to gather and process information over several steps if needed. You can see this in action by adding another tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Update Your Route Handler
Update your app/api/chat/route.ts file to add a new tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

app/api/chat/route.ts

import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
    tools: {
      weather: tool({
        description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
        parameters: z.object({
          location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ location }) => {
          const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
          return {
            location,
            temperature,
          };
        },
      }),
      convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
        description: 'Convert a temperature in fahrenheit to celsius',
        parameters: z.object({
          temperature: z
            .number()
            .describe('The temperature in fahrenheit to convert'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
          const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
          return {
            celsius,
          };
        },
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
Now, when you ask "What's the weather in New York in celsius?", you should see a more complete interaction:

The model will call the weather tool for New York.
You'll see the tool result displayed.
It will then call the temperature conversion tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The model will then use that information to provide a natural language response about the weather in New York.
This multi-step approach allows the model to gather information and use it to provide more accurate and contextual responses, making your chatbot considerably more useful.

This simple example demonstrates how tools can expand your model's capabilities. You can create more complex tools to integrate with real APIs, databases, or any other external systems, allowing the model to access and process real-world data in real-time. Tools bridge the gap between the model's knowledge cutoff and current information.

To jumpstart your first AI project, explore available templates.
Next.js Pages Router Quickstart
The AI SDK is a powerful Typescript library designed to help developers build AI-powered applications.

In this quickstart tutorial, you'll build a simple AI-chatbot with a streaming user interface. Along the way, you'll learn key concepts and techniques that are fundamental to using the SDK in your own projects.

If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of Prompt Engineering and HTTP Streaming, you can optionally read these documents first.

Prerequisites
To follow this quickstart, you'll need:

Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.
An OpenAI API key.
If you haven't obtained your OpenAI API key, you can do so by signing up on the OpenAI website.

Setup Your Application
Start by creating a new Next.js application. This command will create a new directory named my-ai-app and set up a basic Next.js application inside it.

Be sure to select no when prompted to use the App Router. If you are looking for the Next.js App Router quickstart guide, you can find it here.

pnpm create next-app@latest my-ai-app
Navigate to the newly created directory:

cd my-ai-app
Install dependencies
Install ai, @ai-sdk/react, and @ai-sdk/openai, the AI package, AI SDK's React hooks, and AI SDK's OpenAI provider respectively.

The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just one line of code! Learn more about available providers and building custom providers in the providers section.

pnpm
npm
yarn
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai zod
Make sure you are using ai version 3.1 or higher.

Configure OpenAI API Key
Create a .env.local file in your project root and add your OpenAI API Key. This key is used to authenticate your application with the OpenAI service.

touch .env.local
Edit the .env.local file:

.env.local

OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
Replace xxxxxxxxx with your actual OpenAI API key.

The AI SDK's OpenAI Provider will default to using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a fullstack React framework for the web, maintained by Vercel.

While Next.js works when self-hosting, deploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

To get started with Next.js on Vercel:

*   If you already have a project with Next.js, install [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory
*   Clone one of our Next.js example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:

[![](https://assets.vercel.com/image/upload/v1689795055/docs-assets/static/topics/icons/next.svg)Deploy our Next.js template, or view a live example.](/templates/next.js/nextjs-boilerplate)

[Deploy](/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fnextjs&template=nextjs)[Live Example](https://nextjs-template.vercel.app/)

*   Or, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:

Vercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) for each pull request you make to your Next.js project.

## [Incremental Static Regeneration](#incremental-static-regeneration)

[Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to create or update content _without_ redeploying your site. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.

When self-hosting, (ISR) is limited to a single region workload. Statically generated pages are not distributed closer to visitors by default, without additional configuration or vendoring of a CDN. By default, self-hosted ISR does _not_ persist generated pages to durable storage. Instead, these files are located in the Next.js cache (which expires).

To enable ISR with Next.js in the `app` router, add an options object with a `revalidate` property to your `fetch` requests:

Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)

```
await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {
  next: { revalidate: 10 }, // Seconds
});
```

To summarize, using ISR with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Better performance with our global [Edge Network](/docs/edge-network)
*   Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in 300ms
*   Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage

[Learn more about Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration)

## [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](#server-side-rendering-ssr)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.

On Vercel, you can server-render Next.js applications through [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions).

To summarize, SSR with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Scales to zero when not in use
*   Scales automatically with traffic increases
*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control` headers](/docs/edge-network/caching), including `stale-while-revalidate`
*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables automatic creation of Functions for SSR

[Learn more about SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#static-and-dynamic-rendering-on-the-server)

## [Streaming](#streaming)

Vercel supports streaming in Next.js projects with any of the following:

*   [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers)
*   [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/streaming-functions)
*   React Server Components

Streaming data allows you to fetch information in chunks rather than all at once, speeding up Function responses. You can use streams to improve your app's user experience and prevent your functions from failing when fetching large files.

#### [Streaming with `loading` and `Suspense`](#streaming-with-loading-and-suspense)

In the Next.js App Router, you can use the `loading` file convention or a `Suspense` component to show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads.

The `loading` file provides a way to show a loading state for a whole route or route-segment, instead of just particular sections of a page. This file affects all its child elements, including layouts and pages. It continues to display its contents until the data fetching process in the route segment completes.

The following example demonstrates a basic `loading` file:

```
export default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}
```

Learn more about loading in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming).

The `Suspense` component, introduced in React 18, enables you to display a fallback until components nested within it have finished loading. Using `Suspense` is more granular than showing a loading state for an entire route, and is useful when only sections of your UI need a loading state.

You can specify a component to show during the loading state with the `fallback` prop on the `Suspense` component as shown below:

```
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './components';
 
export default function Posts() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
        <PostFeed />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
        <Weather />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  );
}
```

To summarize, using Streaming with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Speeds up Function response times, improving your app's user experience
*   Display initial loading UI with incremental updates from the server as new data becomes available

Learn more about [Streaming](/docs/functions/streaming-functions) with Vercel Functions.

## [Partial Prerendering](#partial-prerendering)

Partial Prerendering as an experimental feature. It is currently **not suitable for production** environments.

Partial Prerendering (PPR) is an experimental feature in Next.js that allows the static portions of a page to be pre-generated and served from the cache, while the dynamic portions are streamed in a single HTTP request.

When a user visits a route:

*   A static route _shell_ is served immediately, this makes the initial load fast.
*   The shell leaves _holes_ where dynamic content will be streamed in to minimize the perceived overall page load time.
*   The async holes are loaded in parallel, reducing the overall load time of the page.

This approach is useful for pages like dashboards, where unique, per-request data coexists with static elements such as sidebars or layouts. This is different from how your application behaves today, where entire routes are either fully static or dynamic.

See the [Partial Prerendering docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/partial-prerendering) to learn more.

## [Image Optimization](#image-optimization)

[Image Optimization](/docs/image-optimization) helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.

When deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and [Core Web Vitals](/docs/speed-insights).

When self-hosting, Image Optimization uses the default Next.js server for optimization. This server manages the rendering of pages and serving of static files.

To use Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel, import the `next/image` component into the component you'd like to add an image to, as shown in the following example:

Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)

```
import Image from 'next/image'
 
interface ExampleProps {
  name: string;
}
 
const ExampleComponent = (props: ExampleProps) : => {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src="example.png"
        alt="Example picture"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <span>{props.name}</span>
    </>
  )
}
```

To summarize, using Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Zero-configuration Image Optimization when using `next/image`
*   Helps your team ensure great performance by default
*   Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand
*   Requires No additional services needed to procure or set up

[Learn more about Image Optimization](/docs/image-optimization)

## [Font Optimization](#font-optimization)

[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) enables built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero [layout shift](/docs/speed-insights#cumulative-layout-shift-cls), thanks to the underlying CSS [`size-adjust`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/size-adjust) property.

This also allows you to use all [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.

Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)

```
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight
const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
});
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To summarize, using Font Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Enables built-in, automatic self-hosting for font files
*   Loads web fonts with zero layout shift
*   Allows for CSS and font files to be downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files
*   Ensures that no requests are sent to Google by the browser

[Learn more about Font Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)

## [Open Graph Images](#open-graph-images)

Dynamic social card images (using the [Open Graph protocol](/docs/og-image-generation)) allow you to create a unique image for every page of your site. This is useful when sharing links on the web through social platforms or through text message.

The [Vercel OG](/docs/og-image-generation) image generation library allows you generate fast, dynamic social card images using Next.js API Routes.

The following example demonstrates using OG image generation in both the Next.js Pages and App Router:

Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)

```
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og';
// App router includes @vercel/og.
// No need to install it.
 
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'white',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          textAlign: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        Hello world!
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 600,
    },
  );
}
```

To see your generated image, run `npm run dev` in your terminal and visit the `/api/og` route in your browser (most likely `http://localhost:3000/api/og`).

To summarize, the benefits of using Vercel OG with Next.js include:

*   Instant, dynamic social card images without needing headless browsers
*   Generated images are automatically cached on the Vercel Edge Network
*   Image generation is co-located with the rest of your frontend codebase

[Learn more about OG Image Generation](/docs/og-image-generation)

## [Middleware](#middleware)

[Middleware](/docs/edge-middleware) is code that executes before a request is processed. Because Middleware runs before the cache, it's an effective way of providing personalization to statically generated content.

When deploying middleware with Next.js on Vercel, you get access to built-in helpers that expose each request's geolocation information. You also get access to the `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` objects, which enable rewrites, continuing the middleware chain, and more.

See [the Middleware API docs](/docs/edge-middleware/middleware-api#middleware-helper-methods) for more information.

To summarize, Middleware with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Runs using [Edge Middleware](/docs/edge-middleware) which are deployed globally
*   Replaces needing additional services for customizable routing rules
*   Helps you achieve the best performance for serving content globally

[Learn more about Edge Middleware](/docs/edge-middleware)

## [Draft Mode](#draft-mode)

[Draft Mode](/docs/draft-mode) enables you to view draft content from your [Headless CMS](/docs/solutions/cms) immediately, while still statically generating pages in production.

See [our Draft Mode docs](/docs/draft-mode#using-draft-mode-with-next.js) to learn how to use it with Next.js.

### [Self-hosting Draft Mode](#self-hosting-draft-mode)

When self-hosting, every request using Draft Mode hits the Next.js server, potentially incurring extra load or cost. Further, by spoofing the cookie, malicious users could attempt to gain access to your underlying Next.js server.

### [Draft Mode security](#draft-mode-security)

Deployments on Vercel automatically secure Draft Mode behind the same authentication used for Preview Comments. In order to enable or disable Draft Mode, the viewer must be logged in as a member of the [Team](/docs/teams-and-accounts). Once enabled, Vercel's Edge Network will bypass the ISR cache automatically and invoke the underlying [Serverless Function](/docs/functions/serverless-functions).

### [Enabling Draft Mode in Preview Deployments](#enabling-draft-mode-in-preview-deployments)

You and your team members can toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar in [production](/docs/vercel-toolbar/in-production-and-localhost/add-to-production), [localhost](/docs/vercel-toolbar/in-production-and-localhost/add-to-localhost), and [Preview Deployments](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production#comments). When you do so, the toolbar will become purple to indicate Draft Mode is active.

![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-light.png&w=828&q=75)![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-dark.png&w=828&q=75)

The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.

Users outside your Vercel team cannot toggle Draft Mode.

To summarize, the benefits of using Draft Mode with Next.js on Vercel include:

*   Easily server-render previews of static pages
*   Adds additional security measures to prevent malicious usage
*   Integrates with any headless provider of your choice
*   You can enable and disable Draft Mode in [the comments toolbar](/docs/comments/how-comments-work) on Preview Deployments

[Learn more about Draft Mode](/docs/draft-mode)

## [Web Analytics](#web-analytics)

Vercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.

To use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.

To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our `@vercel/analytics` package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your Next.js project:

pnpmyarnnpmbun

```
pnpm i @vercel/analytics
```

Then, follow the instructions below to add the `Analytics` component to your app either using the `pages` directory or the `app` directory.

The `Analytics` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js, including route support.

Add the following code to the root layout:

Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)

```
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To summarize, Web Analytics with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
*   Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation, and more

[Learn more about Web Analytics](/docs/analytics)

## [Speed Insights](#speed-insights)

You can see data about your project's [Core Web Vitals](/docs/speed-insights#core-web-vitals-explained) performance in your dashboard on Vercel. Doing so will allow you to track your web application's loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability so you can improve the overall user experience.

On Vercel, you can track your Next.js app's Core Web Vitals in your project's dashboard.

### [reportWebVitals](#reportwebvitals)

If you're self-hosting your app, you can use the [`useWebVitals`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance#build-your-own) hook to send metrics to any analytics provider. The following example demonstrates a custom `WebVitals` component that you can use in your app's root `layout` file:

```
'use client';
 
import { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals';
 
export function WebVitals() {
  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
    console.log(metric);
  });
}
```

You could then reference your custom `WebVitals` component like this:

```
import { WebVitals } from './_components/web-vitals';
 
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <WebVitals />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Next.js uses [Google's `web-vitals` library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#web-vitals) to measure the Web Vitals metrics available in `reportWebVitals`.

To summarize, tracking Web Vitals with Next.js on Vercel:

*   Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as [First Contentful Paint](/docs/speed-insights#first-contentful-paint-fcp), or [First Input Delay](/docs/speed-insights#first-input-delay-fid)

Server and Client Components
By default, layouts and pages are Server Components, which lets you fetch data and render parts of your UI on the server, optionally cache the result, and stream it to the client. When you need interactivity or browser APIs, you can use Client Components to layer in functionality.

This page explains how Server and Client Components work in Next.js and when to use them, with examples of how to compose them together in your application.

When to use Server and Client Components?
The client and server environments have different capabilities. Server and Client components allow you to run logic in each environment depending on your use case.

Use Client Components when you need:

State and event handlers. E.g. onClick, onChange.
Lifecycle logic. E.g. useEffect.
Browser-only APIs. E.g. localStorage, window, Navigator.geolocation, etc.
Custom hooks.
Use Server Components when you need:

Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.
Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
Improve the First Contentful Paint (FCP), and stream content progressively to the client.
For example, the <Page> component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the <LikeButton> which handles client-side interactivity.

app/[id]/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
app/ui/like-button.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
How do Server and Client Components work in Next.js?
On the server
On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments (layouts and pages):

Server Components are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
Client Components and the RSC Payload are used to prerender HTML.
What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?

The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:

The rendered result of Server Components
Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component
On the client (first load)
Then, on the client:

HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
RSC Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
JavaScript is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.
What is hydration?

Hydration is React's process for attaching event handlers to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.

Subsequent Navigations
On subsequent navigations:

The RSC Payload is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
Client Components are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.
Examples
Using Client Components
You can create a Client Component by adding the "use client" directive at the top of the file, above your imports.

app/ui/counter.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
"use client" is used to declare a boundary between the Server and Client module graphs (trees).

Once a file is marked with "use client", all its imports and child components are considered part of the client bundle. This means you don't need to add the directive to every component that is intended for the client.

Reducing JS bundle size
To reduce the size of your client JavaScript bundles, add 'use client' to specific interactive components instead of marking large parts of your UI as Client Components.

For example, the <Layout> component contains mostly static elements like a logo and navigation links, but includes an interactive search bar. <Search /> is interactive and needs to be a Client Component, however, the rest of the layout can remain a Server Component.

app/layout.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'
 
// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
app/ui/search.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
Passing data from Server to Client Components
You can pass data from Server Components to Client Components using props.

app/[id]/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)
 
  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
app/ui/like-button.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
Alternatively, you can stream data from a Server Component to a Client Component with the use Hook. See an example.

Good to know: Props passed to Client Components need to be serializable by React.

Interleaving Server and Client Components
You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component. This allows you to visually nest server-rendered UI within Client components.

A common pattern is to use children to create a slot in a <ClientComponent>. For example, a <Cart> component that fetches data on the server, inside a <Modal> component that uses client state to toggle visibility.

app/ui/modal.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
Then, in a parent Server Component (e.g.<Page>), you can pass a <Cart> as the child of the <Modal>:

app/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
In this pattern, all Server Components will be rendered on the server ahead of time, including those as props. The resulting RSC payload will contain references of where Client Components should be rendered within the component tree.

Context providers
React context is commonly used to share global state like the current theme. However, React context is not supported in Server Components.

To use context, create a Client Component that accepts children:

app/theme-provider.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { createContext } from 'react'
 
export const ThemeContext = createContext({})
 
export default function ThemeProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
Then, import it into a Server Component (e.g. layout):

app/layout.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider, and all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.

Good to know: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how ThemeProvider only wraps {children} instead of the entire <html> document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.

Third-party components
When using a third-party component that relies on client-only features, you can wrap it in a Client Component to ensure it works as expected.

For example, the <Carousel /> can be imported from the acme-carousel package. This component uses useState, but it doesn't yet have the "use client" directive.

If you use <Carousel /> within a Client Component, it will work as expected:

app/gallery.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'
 
export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error. This is because Next.js doesn't know <Carousel /> is using client-only features.

To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:

app/carousel.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'
 
export default Carousel
Now, you can use <Carousel /> directly within a Server Component:

app/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import Carousel from './carousel'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
Advice for Library Authors

If you’re building a component library, add the "use client" directive to entry points that rely on client-only features. This lets your users import components into Server Components without needing to create wrappers.

It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out "use client" directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the "use client" directive in the React Wrap Balancer and Vercel Analytics repositories.

Preventing environment poisoning
JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules. This means it's possible to accidentally import server-only code into the client. For example, consider the following function:

lib/data.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })
 
  return res.json()
}
This function contains an API_KEY that should never be exposed to the client.

In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are included in the client bundle. If variables are not prefixed, Next.js replaces them with an empty string.

As a result, even though getData() can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected.

To prevent accidental usage in Client Components, you can use the server-only package.

Then, import the package into a file that contains server-only code:

lib/data.js

import 'server-only'
 
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })
 
  return res.json()
}
Now, if you try to import the module into a Client Component, there will be a build-time error.

The corresponding client-only package can be used to mark modules that contain client-only logic like code that accesses the window object.

In Next.js, installing server-only or client-only is optional. However, if your linting rules flag extraneous dependencies, you may install them to avoid issues.

pnpm
npm
yarn
bun
Terminal

pnpm add server-only
Next.js handles server-only and client-only imports internally to provide clearer error messages when a module is used in the wrong environment. The contents of these packages from NPM are not used by Next.js.

Next.js also provides its own type declarations for server-only and client-only, for TypeScript configurations where noUncheckedSideEffectImports is active.
---

## 1. Tailwind CSS & PostCSS Configuration

- **There must be a single `postcss.config.mjs` (or `.js`) at the project root:**
  ```js
  export default {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
  };
  ```
- **`tailwind.config.ts` must include all relevant content paths:**
  ```ts
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './public/**/*.svg',
    './app/globals.css',
  ],
  ```
- **`app/globals.css` is the only source of global styles.**
  - Must start with `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`.
  - All custom CSS variables and `@layer` rules go here.
- **No duplicate or legacy CSS files in `styles/` or `src/app/`.**

---

## 2. Static Asset Loading

- **All static assets (SVG, PNG, etc.) must be in `/public` or subfolders.**
- **No direct imports of assets from outside `/public`.**
- **All asset URLs must be relative to `/public` (e.g., `/assets/logo.svg`).**

---

## 3. Module Import/Export Hygiene

- **All imports must use path aliases as defined in `tsconfig.json`.**
- **No imports from files or modules that do not exist.**
- **All exports must be explicitly defined.**
- **No circular dependencies.**

---

## 4. Edge Runtime Compatibility

- **No Node.js APIs (e.g., `process.memoryUsage`, `fs`, `path`) in any code that runs in Edge API routes or middleware.**
- **If Edge runtime is required, use only Web APIs.**
- **All Edge routes must be clearly documented.**

---

## 5. React Context & Prerendering

- **All context providers (e.g., ThemeProvider) must wrap the app in `app/layout.tsx`.**
- **No context usage outside of a provider.**
- **All pages/components must be SSR/SSG safe.**
- **No direct DOM access in server components.**

---

## 6. Directory Structure

- **There must be only one `app/` directory at the project root.**
- **`src/app/` is forbidden. If present, it must be deleted.**
- **`tsconfig.json` and `next.config.ts` must not reference `src/app/`.**
- **All components must be in `/components` or subfolders.**

---

## 7. Build & Linting

- **`npm run build` must succeed with zero errors.**
- **All warnings must be triaged and fixed or explicitly documented.**
- **ESLint and TypeScript must be enabled and pass on all code.**

---

## 8. Verification Checklist (Before PR Merge)

- [ ] `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- [ ] No duplicate or legacy directories (`src/app/`, `styles/`)
- [ ] No unknown Tailwind or PostCSS errors in the browser or build logs
- [ ] All static assets load correctly in the browser
- [ ] No import/export errors in the build
- [ ] No Node.js APIs in Edge code
- [ ] All context providers are present in `app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] All lint and type errors are resolved

---

## 9. Ongoing Maintenance

- **This document must be updated with every structural or configuration change.**
- **All contributors must review this document before making changes.**
- **Any deviation must be justified and approved in a PR discussion.**

---

## 10. Rationale

- **Single source of truth prevents drift and confusion.**
- **Strict directory and config rules prevent build/runtime errors.**
- **Clear verification steps ensure production readiness.**

---

## 11. Appendix: Common Pitfalls

- Multiple `app/` or `src/app/` directories
- Unprocessed Tailwind/PostCSS (missing config or import)
- Node.js APIs in Edge runtime
- Context not provided at the root
- Asset paths not relative to `/public`
- Import/export mismatches

---

**This file is the canonical reference for all frontend and build system decisions.**

### 2. Security Implementation

#### Prompt Injection Prevention
```typescript
// Input sanitization strategy
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  // Remove potential injection patterns
  const dangerous = [
    /ignore\s+previous\s+instructions/gi,
    /system\s*:/gi,
    /assistant\s*:/gi,
    /<script.*?>/gi,
    /javascript:/gi
  ];
  
  let cleaned = input;
  dangerous.forEach(pattern => {
    cleaned = cleaned.replace(pattern, '[REMOVED]');
  });
  
  return cleaned.slice(0, 2000); // Limit length
};
```

#### SVG Security Scanning
```typescript
const securityChecks = {
  disallowed_elements: ['script', 'foreignObject', 'use'],
  disallowed_attributes: ['onload', 'onclick', 'onerror'],
  disallowed_protocols: ['javascript:', 'data:text/html'],
  max_file_size: 15 * 1024 // 15KB
};
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Token Management
- **Budget per stage**: A(200), B(500), C(150), D(800), E(300), F(400), G(1000), H(50)
- **Total budget**: ~3400 tokens average per generation
- **Cost estimation**: $0.15-0.30 per complete generation

#### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Cache identical briefs for 1 hour
const cacheKey = crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update(JSON.stringify({ brief, images }))
  .digest('hex');
```

#### Streaming Implementation
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Progressive enhancement with fallback to polling
- Client-side progress tracking and error recovery

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience

#### Retry Logic
```typescript
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  backoffMultiplier: 2,
  initialDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 10000
};
```

#### Fallback Strategies
- Stage D failure → Simplified geometric logo generation
- Stage G failure → Basic template-based guidelines
- Packaging failure → Individual file downloads

#### Error Categories
1. **User Input Errors**: Invalid brief, unsupported files
2. **AI Generation Errors**: Model failures, malformed outputs
3. **Processing Errors**: SVG parsing, image conversion failures
4. **System Errors**: Rate limits, network issues, storage problems

### 5. Quality Assurance

#### Automated Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Test pyramid structure
const testSuite = {
  unit: {
    coverage: '90%+',
    focus: 'Individual stage functions'
  },
  integration: {
    coverage: '80%+', 
    focus: 'Pipeline flow, API endpoints'
  },
  e2e: {
    coverage: 'Critical paths',
    focus: 'User journeys, file downloads'
  }
};
```

```typescript
interface RequirementExtractionConfig {
  model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022';
  temperature: 0.1;
  max_tokens: 500;
  timeout: 10_000; // 10 seconds
}

interface DesignSpecification {
  brand_name: string;
  brand_description: string;
  style_preferences: string;
  color_palette: string;
  imagery_requirements: string;
  target_audience: string;
  additional_constraints: string;
  confidence_score: number; // 0-1
}
```

#### Stage D: SVG Generation Constraints
```typescript
interface SVGGenerationConfig {
  max_file_size: 15_360; // 15KB
  viewBox: '0 0 300 300';
  allowed_elements: [
    'svg', 'g', 'path', 'circle', 'rect', 
    'polygon', 'text', 'defs', 'linearGradient'
  ];
  forbidden_elements: [
    'script', 'foreignObject', 'image', 'video'
  ];
  max_colors: 5;
  accessibility_required: true;
}
```

### 2. Security Implementation

#### Input Sanitization
```typescript
class InputSanitizer {
  static sanitizeBrief(input: string): string {
    // Remove potential injection patterns
    const patterns = [
      /ignore\s+previous\s+instructions/gi,
      /system\s*:/gi,
      /<script.*?>/gi,
      /javascript:/gi,
      /\{\{.*?\}\}/g, // Template injection
      /\$\{.*?\}/g    // Variable injection
    ];
    
    let sanitized = input;
    patterns.forEach(pattern => {
      sanitized = sanitized.replace(pattern, '[FILTERED]');
    });
    
    return sanitized.slice(0, 2000); // Length limit
  }
  
  static validateSVG(svgContent: string): SecurityValidationResult {
    const security_checks = {
      has_scripts: /<script/i.test(svgContent),
      has_external_refs: /href\s*=\s*["'][^"']*:\/\//i.test(svgContent),
      has_event_handlers: /on\w+\s*=/i.test(svgContent),
      size_exceeds_limit: svgContent.length > 15360
    };
    
    return {
      is_safe: Object.values(security_checks).every(check => !check),
      violations: security_checks
    };
  }
}
```

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  private static requests = new Map<string, RequestInfo>();
  
  static check(identifier: string): RateLimitResult {
    const now = Date.now();
    const windowMs = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
    const maxRequests = 10;
    
    const requestInfo = this.requests.get(identifier) || {
      count: 0,
      resetTime: now + windowMs
    };
    
    if (now > requestInfo.resetTime) {
      requestInfo.count = 1;
      requestInfo.resetTime = now + windowMs;
    } else if (requestInfo.count >= maxRequests) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        retryAfter: requestInfo.resetTime - now
      };
    } else {
      requestInfo.count++;
    }
    
    this.requests.set(identifier, requestInfo);
    return { allowed: true };
  }
}
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

#### Error Classification
```typescript
enum ErrorType {
  USER_INPUT_ERROR = 'user_input_error',
  AI_GENERATION_ERROR = 'ai_generation_error', 
  PROCESSING_ERROR = 'processing_error',
  SYSTEM_ERROR = 'system_error'
}

class ErrorHandler {
  static handle(error: Error, stage: string): ErrorResponse {
    const errorInfo = this.classifyError(error, stage);
    
    switch (errorInfo.type) {
      case ErrorType.USER_INPUT_ERROR:
        return {
          recovery: 'retry_with_guidance',
          message: 'Please refine your logo requirements and try again.',
          suggestions: this.getUserInputSuggestions(error)
        };
        
      case ErrorType.AI_GENERATION_ERROR:
        return {
          recovery: 'retry_with_fallback',
          message: 'Generation failed. Trying alternative approach...',
          fallback_enabled: true
        };
        
      case ErrorType.PROCESSING_ERROR:
        return {
          recovery: 'retry_processing',
          message: 'Processing error. Retrying...',
          retry_count: errorInfo.retryCount + 1
        };
        
      default:
        return {
          recovery: 'escalate_to_support',
          message: 'System error. Our team has been notified.',
          error_id: this.logError(error, stage)
        };
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy
```typescript
class GenerationCache {
  private static cache = new Map<string, CacheEntry>();
  
  static getCacheKey(brief: string, images?: string[]): string {
    const content = JSON.stringify({ brief, images });
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(content).digest('hex');
  }
  
  static get(key: string): CacheEntry | null {
    const entry = this.cache.get(key);
    if (!entry || Date.now() > entry.expiresAt) {
      this.cache.delete(key);
      return null;
    }
    return entry;
  }
  
  static set(key: string, data: GenerationResult): void {
    const expiresAt = Date.now() + (60 * 60 * 1000); // 1 hour
    this.cache.set(key, { data, expiresAt });
  }
}
```

#### Token Optimization
```typescript
interface TokenBudget {
  stage_a: 200;   // Requirement extraction
  stage_b: 500;   // Concept generation
  stage_c: 150;   // Concept selection
  stage_d: 800;   // SVG generation
  stage_e: 100;   // Validation (mostly non-AI)
  stage_f: 400;   // Variant generation
  stage_g: 1000;  // Brand guidelines
  total_budget: 3150;
  cost_estimate: 0.15; // USD per generation
}
```
