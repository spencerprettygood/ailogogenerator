# 007. Performance Monitoring Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the AI Logo Generator application grows in complexity and usage, we need a robust way to monitor system performance, track resource usage, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal user experience. Key performance metrics we need to track include:

1. API response times
2. Pipeline stage durations
3. Token usage and costs
4. Memory consumption
5. Error rates and patterns
6. Cache effectiveness

We need a monitoring solution that:
- Has minimal performance impact on the application
- Provides real-time visibility into system behavior
- Allows for historical analysis of trends
- Can be used in both development and production
- Integrates well with our existing architecture
- Provides actionable insights for optimization

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive performance monitoring system with the following components:

1. **Core Monitoring Utility**:
   - Create a singleton `PerformanceMonitor` class
   - Track various metric types (timing, API, tokens, memory, errors)
   - Provide both real-time and historical data access
   - Support filtering and aggregation of metrics

2. **API Integration**:
   - Add middleware to automatically track API performance
   - Use Higher-Order Functions to wrap API handlers
   - Record request/response sizes and durations
   - Track status codes and error rates

3. **Pipeline Monitoring**:
   - Track each pipeline stage individually
   - Measure token usage by stage
   - Calculate success rates and durations
   - Store performance history for estimation improvements

4. **Administrative Dashboard**:
   - Create a real-time performance dashboard
   - Show key metrics and trends
   - Allow filtering by time ranges and categories
   - Provide actionable insights for optimization

5. **Memory Usage Tracking**:
   - Record heap and RSS memory consumption
   - Track memory growth patterns
   - Identify potential memory leaks
   - Monitor resource utilization

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Visibility**: Gain insight into system performance in real-time
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
3. **Resource Planning**: Better understand token usage and costs
4. **Error Detection**: Early detection of issues and patterns
5. **User Experience**: Monitor and improve response times
6. **Debugging**: Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed metrics

### Negative

1. **Performance Overhead**: Some performance impact from metrics collection
2. **Development Complexity**: Additional code to maintain
3. **Storage Requirements**: Need to manage metrics retention
4. **Security Considerations**: Must ensure sensitive data isn't exposed in metrics

### Mitigations

1. **Configurable Enabling/Disabling**: Allow turning monitoring on/off
2. **Sampling**: Consider sampling in high-load situations
3. **Retention Policies**: Implement limits on metrics storage
4. **Secure Dashboard**: Restrict access to admin dashboard
5. **Metric Filtering**: Filter sensitive information from metrics

## Implementation

1. **Core Components**:
   - `PerformanceMonitor` singleton class
   - Metric interfaces for different data types
   - Consumer pattern for real-time updates

2. **Middleware Implementation**:
   - Higher-order functions for API route monitoring
   - Request/response tracking logic
   - Error capturing and recording

3. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Filtering and time range selection
   - Summary statistics and insights

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Logo generation pipeline instrumentation
   - Token usage tracking
   - Memory monitoring
   - API endpoint performance
