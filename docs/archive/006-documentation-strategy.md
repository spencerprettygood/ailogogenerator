# 006. Documentation Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI Logo Generator codebase is growing in complexity with multiple components, libraries, and utility functions. As the codebase expands, it becomes increasingly important to have comprehensive and up-to-date documentation to:

1. Help new developers onboard quickly
2. Provide clear understanding of the system architecture
3. Document API interfaces and function behaviors
4. Ensure consistent implementation across the codebase
5. Reduce the learning curve for contributors

We need to determine an effective documentation strategy that:
- Keeps documentation close to the code
- Minimizes maintenance overhead
- Is automatically enforced and verified
- Provides easy access to documentation
- Supports TypeScript-specific features

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive documentation strategy based on TypeDoc with the following components:

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Use JSDoc-style comments for all public APIs, interfaces, classes, and components
   - Include examples, parameter descriptions, return type explanations, and usage notes
   - Document component props, hooks, utility functions, and class methods
   - Follow standardized templates for different code types

2. **Automated Generation**:
   - Use TypeDoc to automatically generate API documentation from code comments
   - Generate both HTML and Markdown versions of the documentation
   - Automate documentation builds as part of CI/CD pipeline

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Create and maintain documentation templates for different code elements
   - Follow a consistent style for all documentation
   - Include examples with all public APIs

4. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Add documentation building to CI pipeline
   - Add pre-commit hooks to verify documentation quality
   - Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages when merged to main

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Provide easy access to documentation through npm scripts
   - Include documentation status in PR reviews
   - Create architecture diagrams and design docs for complex systems

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Documentation is always up-to-date as it lives with the code
2. New contributors can quickly understand the codebase
3. Type information is automatically included in the documentation
4. Examples provide clear usage patterns
5. Standardized approach leads to consistent documentation
6. CI/CD integration ensures documentation quality

### Negative

1. Initial effort to document existing code
2. Requires discipline to maintain documentation quality
3. May slow down development initially as proper documentation is required
4. Additional build steps in the CI pipeline

### Mitigations

1. Prioritize documentation for core APIs and components first
2. Create templates to make documentation easier
3. Automate as much as possible
4. Add pre-commit hooks to catch documentation issues early

## Implementation

1. Install and configure TypeDoc and plugins
2. Create documentation templates for different code types
3. Set up documentation build scripts
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
5. Create pre-commit hooks for documentation validation
6. Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
7. Add documentation for core APIs and components
