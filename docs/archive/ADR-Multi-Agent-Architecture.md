# Architecture Decision Record: Multi-Agent Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI Logo Generator requires a complex workflow that transforms natural language descriptions into complete branding packages, including SVG logos, PNG variants, monochrome versions, favicons, and brand guidelines. This process involves multiple specialized tasks that each require different capabilities, including:

1. Analyzing user requirements
2. Generating visual concepts
3. Selecting the best concept
4. Creating SVG logo code
5. Validating and repairing SVG
6. Generating logo variants
7. Creating brand guidelines
8. Packaging assets for delivery

Each of these tasks requires different reasoning capabilities, prompt engineering approaches, and levels of AI model sophistication. Additionally, we need to:

- Track progress through the complex workflow
- Handle errors and retry logic consistently
- Share state between different stages
- Manage token usage efficiently
- Provide clear separation of concerns

The traditional monolithic approach to AI interactions (single prompt, single response) is insufficient for this complexity.

## Decision

We will implement a Multi-Agent Architecture pattern where:

1. Each specialized task is implemented as a separate "agent" with:
   - Well-defined input/output interfaces
   - Task-specific system prompts
   - Specialized processing capabilities
   - Isolated error handling

2. A Multi-Agent Orchestrator will:
   - Coordinate agent execution based on an execution plan
   - Manage dependencies between agents
   - Handle shared memory and message passing
   - Provide unified progress tracking and error handling

3. A Base Agent abstract class will:
   - Provide common functionality for all agents
   - Standardize initialization, execution, and metrics collection
   - Implement consistent retry logic
   - Support different AI model capabilities

4. The system will support both:
   - Sequential agent execution for dependent tasks
   - Parallel agent execution for independent tasks

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Separation of concerns**: Each agent focuses on one specialized task with its own prompt engineering and validation logic.

2. **Improved maintainability**: Agents can be developed, tested, and optimized independently, making the codebase more modular.

3. **Flexible AI model usage**: Different agents can use different models (e.g., Sonnet for creative tasks, Haiku for fast analysis) to optimize cost and performance.

4. **Better error handling**: Failures are isolated to specific agents and can be retried without restarting the entire process.

5. **Enhanced observability**: Each agent produces detailed metrics about token usage, execution time, and retry counts.

6. **Intelligent dependency management**: The orchestrator manages dependencies between agents, ensuring required data is available.

7. **Consistent progress tracking**: The unified orchestration provides accurate progress updates for the user interface.

8. **Support for parallel execution**: Independent tasks can be executed concurrently to reduce overall generation time.

### Negative

1. **Increased complexity**: The multi-agent approach adds architectural complexity compared to a monolithic implementation.

2. **Shared memory management**: Agents must coordinate through shared memory, requiring careful data structure design.

3. **Potential latency increase**: Multiple separate API calls may increase overall latency compared to a single large call.

4. **Context loss between agents**: Each agent operates with limited context from previous stages, possibly losing nuanced information.

5. **More API calls**: Multiple API calls increase the potential for rate limit issues and network failures.

## Implementation Details

### Agent Base Class

All specialized agents inherit from a common `BaseAgent` abstract class that provides:

- Standardized initialization process
- Consistent execution flow
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- Uniform metrics collection
- Specialized AI model selection based on agent capabilities

```typescript
export abstract class BaseAgent implements Agent {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  status: AgentStatus = 'idle';
  metrics: AgentMetrics = { /* ... */ };
  config: AgentConfig;
  protected context?: AgentContext;
  protected systemPrompt: string = '';
  
  // Standard execution flow with error handling and retry logic
  async execute(input: AgentInput): Promise<AgentOutput> {
    // Implementation...
  }
  
  // Abstract methods that specialized agents must implement
  protected abstract generatePrompt(input: AgentInput): Promise<string>;
  protected abstract processResponse(responseContent: string, originalInput: AgentInput): Promise<AgentOutput>;
}
```

### Specialized Agents

Each specialized agent focuses on a specific task:

1. **RequirementsAgent**: Analyzes user brief to extract structured design specifications
2. **MoodboardAgent**: Generates multiple design concepts based on requirements
3. **SelectionAgent**: Evaluates concepts and selects the best one
4. **SVGGenerationAgent**: Creates production-ready SVG logo code
5. **SVGValidationAgent**: Validates, repairs, and optimizes SVG code
6. **VariantGenerationAgent**: Creates monochrome variants and favicon
7. **GuidelineAgent**: Generates comprehensive brand guidelines
8. **PackagingAgent**: Packages all assets for delivery

Example specialized agent:

```typescript
export class SVGGenerationAgent extends BaseAgent {
  constructor(config?: Partial<AgentConfig>) {
    super(
      'svg-generation', 
      ['svg-generation'],
      {
        model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620',
        temperature: 0.5,
        maxTokens: 4000,
        ...config
      }
    );
    
    this.systemPrompt = `You are a specialized SVG logo generation agent...`;
  }
  
  protected async generatePrompt(input: SVGGenerationAgentInput): Promise<string> {
    // Task-specific prompt engineering
  }
  
  protected async processResponse(responseContent: string, originalInput: AgentInput): Promise<SVGGenerationAgentOutput> {
    // Specialized response processing and validation
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestrator

The orchestrator coordinates the execution of multiple agents:

1. Manages a registry of all available agents
2. Defines an execution plan with dependencies between agents
3. Maintains shared memory for agent communication
4. Handles sequential and parallel agent execution
5. Processes messages between agents
6. Provides progress tracking and metrics collection

```typescript
export class MultiAgentOrchestrator {
  private agents: AgentMap = {};
  private context: OrchestratorContext;
  private options: OrchestratorOptions;
  private progressCallback?: ProgressUpdateCallback;
  
  // Execution plan defining dependencies between agents
  private createExecutionPlan(): AgentExecutionPlan {
    return {
      stages: [
        {
          id: 'stage-a',
          agents: ['requirements'],
          dependencies: [],
          parallel: false
        },
        // Additional stages...
      ]
    };
  }
  
  // Main execution method
  public async execute(): Promise<OrchestratorResult> {
    // Process the execution plan stage by stage
    for (const stage of this.context.executionPlan.stages) {
      // Check dependencies
      // Execute agents (sequential or parallel)
      // Process message queue
    }
    
    // Create final result
    return result;
  }
}
```

### Integration with Pipeline

The multi-agent system integrates with the higher-level pipeline orchestrator:

1. The pipeline provides a simplified interface for the application
2. It can use either the traditional stage-based approach or the multi-agent system
3. This allows for graceful migration and comparison between approaches

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent Architecture pattern provides a robust, maintainable approach to complex AI workflows like logo generation. By breaking down the process into specialized agents with clear responsibilities, we can better manage the complexity, improve error handling, and optimize the use of different AI models for different tasks.

The pattern introduces some additional complexity but provides significant benefits in terms of modularity, flexibility, and observability that outweigh the costs for this application domain.
