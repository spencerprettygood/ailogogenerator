# OpenTelemetry Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

OpenTelemetry and all related blockers/patches have been fully removed from this project. The application now uses a custom, lightweight telemetry system (`lib/telemetry/`) that is fully compatible with Next.js 15 and works in all environments.

## Why Not OpenTelemetry?

- OpenTelemetry caused build/runtime errors due to Node.js-specific modules and complex dependency chains.
- Next.js 15 projects should use only cross-platform, minimal telemetry solutions.

## Our Solution

- All OpenTelemetry blockers, patches, and config hacks have been deleted.
- The only telemetry system in use is our custom solution in `lib/telemetry/`.
- No OpenTelemetry code, config, or docs remain in the codebase.
