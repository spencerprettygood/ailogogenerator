# Enhanced Streaming Implementation Status

## Overview

The enhanced streaming module (`lib/enhanced-streaming.ts`) is a more advanced version of the current streaming implementation with additional features such as reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, and detailed stage tracking.

## Current Status

- **Development Status**: In progress, not currently used in production
- **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple TypeScript errors need to be fixed before it can be integrated
- **Test Coverage**: Has test file (`lib/enhanced-streaming.test.ts`), but tests will fail until syntax errors are fixed

## Features Planned

- Reliable message delivery with auto-reconnect
- Detailed stage-based progress tracking
- Real-time previews at multiple stages
- Intelligent time estimation
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Heartbeat monitoring for connection stability

## Integration Plan

1. Fix syntax errors in the enhanced streaming implementation
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Create a compatibility layer to make the transition from the current streaming implementation seamless
4. Add monitoring and logging for the enhanced features
5. Gradually roll out to production endpoints

## Priority in Production Readiness

This component is part of Phase 1.3 (Error Handling Improvements) and Phase 2.3 (API Performance) in the production readiness plan. However, since the current streaming implementation is working correctly after the recent fix, the enhanced version can be addressed after more critical items are completed.

## Action Items

- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in the enhanced streaming implementation
- [ ] Update tests to verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Document the additional API and callbacks for developers
- [ ] Create examples showing how to use the enhanced features

## Dependencies

- Current streaming implementation (`lib/streaming.ts`)
- Time estimation utilities (`lib/time-estimation.ts`)
