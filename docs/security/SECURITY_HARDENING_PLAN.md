# Security Hardening Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security hardening measures required for the AI Logo Generator before production deployment. These measures address API key security, authentication, rate limiting, and SVG sanitization to protect both the service and its users.

## Current Security Concerns

1. **API Keys Exposure**: API keys are currently stored in code rather than secure environment variables
2. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Some user inputs may not be properly validated
3. **Missing SVG Sanitization**: Generated SVGs could potentially contain malicious code
4. **Inadequate Rate Limiting**: The system may be vulnerable to abuse without proper request throttling
5. **CORS Configuration**: CORS policies are not configured for production
6. **Lack of Authentication**: Some endpoints don't require proper authentication

## Hardening Measures

### 1. API Key Security

- **Move all API keys to environment variables**
  - Claude API key
  - Database credentials
  - Third-party service credentials
  
- **Implement key rotation strategy**
  - Create documentation for key rotation procedures
  - Set up automatic key rotation for critical services where possible

- **Establish secure key management**
  - Use Vercel Environment Variables for production
  - Use .env.local for local development (with .gitignore)

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Implement robust input validation for all API endpoints**
  - Validate request body against schemas
  - Add type checking for all inputs
  - Sanitize text inputs to prevent injection attacks

- **SVG Sanitization**
  - Implement DOMPurify or similar library for SVG sanitization
  - Remove potentially harmful attributes and scripts
  - Validate SVG structure before serving to users

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Implement proper authentication for sensitive endpoints**
  - Add JWT or session-based authentication
  - Verify user identity before processing requests
  
- **Add role-based access control**
  - Restrict administrative functions to authorized users
  - Implement principle of least privilege for all operations

### 4. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

- **Implement comprehensive rate limiting**
  - Add IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints
  - Add user-based rate limiting for authenticated users
  - Set appropriate limits for different endpoint types

- **Add abuse detection mechanisms**
  - Monitor for suspicious patterns
  - Implement automatic blocking for detected abuse

### 5. CORS & Network Security

- **Configure proper CORS policies**
  - Restrict access to authorized domains
  - Set appropriate headers for production

- **Add network layer protection**
  - Configure appropriate CSP headers
  - Implement HTTP security headers

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**
   - Move all API keys to environment variables
   - Implement SVG sanitization
   - Add basic rate limiting to public endpoints

2. **Short-term (Weeks 2-3)**
   - Complete input validation for all endpoints
   - Configure CORS for production
   - Implement authentication for sensitive operations

3. **Medium-term (Weeks 4-5)**
   - Add comprehensive rate limiting
   - Implement abuse detection
   - Add role-based access control

## Testing & Verification

- **Security Testing Checklist**
  - Penetration testing for API endpoints
  - SVG injection testing
  - Rate limit verification
  - Authentication bypass testing

- **Automated Security Scans**
  - Implement regular automated security scanning
  - Add security linters to CI/CD pipeline

## Documentation

- Create secure deployment guide
- Document API key rotation procedures
- Create security incident response plan

## Conclusion

Implementing this security hardening plan is essential for protecting the AI Logo Generator service and its users. These measures should be prioritized as part of the production readiness effort, with the most critical items addressed immediately before production deployment.
