# TypeScript Message Interface Fix

## Overview

This document details the fix implemented to resolve TypeScript errors related to the Message interface in the AI Logo Generator application.

## Problem

Multiple TypeScript errors were occurring in components that use the `Message` interface, particularly in files like:
- `components/logo-generator/assistant-message.tsx`
- `components/logo-generator/user-message.tsx`
- `components/logo-generator/system-message.tsx`

The errors indicated that properties like `progress` and `assets` that were being accessed on Message objects did not exist in the Message interface. For example:

```typescript
// Error: Property 'progress' does not exist on type 'Message'
if (!message.progress) return null;

// Error: Property 'assets' does not exist on type 'Message'
{message.assets && (
  <LogoPreview assets={message.assets} />
)}
```

## Solution

Updated the `Message` interface in `lib/types.ts` to include the missing properties:

```typescript
export interface Message {
  role: MessageRole;
  content: string | any[] | Record<string, any>; // Support different content types
  timestamp: Date;
  files?: File[];
  id?: string;
  progress?: GenerationProgress; // Added for progress display
  assets?: GeneratedAssets; // Added for asset display
}
```

This change:
1. Makes the `content` property accept different data types (string, array, or object) to accommodate various message formats
2. Adds the `progress` property to support displaying generation progress
3. Adds the `assets` property to support displaying generated assets

## Verification

After making this change, TypeScript errors in the following files are resolved:
- `components/logo-generator/assistant-message.tsx`
- `components/logo-generator/user-message.tsx`
- `components/logo-generator/system-message.tsx`

## Next Steps

Continue with the TypeScript error cleanup plan by addressing:
1. Animation-related type issues
2. Mock code removal in remaining components
3. Standardizing error handling across all components
