# Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing an error during build:

```
The error @layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present
```

This error occurs because the project was using Tailwind's `@layer` directive without including the required `@tailwind base` directive.

## Solution

The issue was fixed by replacing the `@import "tailwindcss";` statement with the proper Tailwind directives in the `globals.css` file:

```css
/* Before */
@import 'tailwindcss';

/* After */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Why This Works

According to Tailwind CSS v4 documentation:

1. The proper way to include Tailwind CSS in a project is through the use of the `@tailwind` directives.
2. These directives tell Tailwind which layers to inject and where they should be placed in your CSS.
3. While `@import "tailwindcss";` is supported, it doesn't properly set up the layering system that `@layer` directives depend on.

## Configuration Details

The project is correctly configured with:

1. **PostCSS Configuration** (`postcss.config.mjs`):

   ```js
   const config = {
     plugins: {
       '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
     },
   };

   export default config;
   ```

2. **Tailwind Configuration** (`tailwind.config.ts`):
   A properly structured configuration file that defines the content sources, theme extensions, and other Tailwind options.

3. **Package Dependencies**:
   ```
   "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.10"
   ```

## Best Practices for Tailwind CSS in Next.js

1. **Proper Directive Order**:
   Always include the three core Tailwind directives in this order:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

2. **Custom Styles**:
   Add custom styles using the `@layer` directive to ensure they work correctly with Tailwind's utility classes:

   ```css
   @layer base {
     /* Base styles */
   }

   @layer components {
     /* Component styles */
   }

   @layer utilities {
     /* Custom utilities */
   }
   ```

3. **Import Order**:
   In the root layout, import the globals.css file before any other styles:
   ```tsx
   // app/layout.tsx
   import './globals.css'; // Must be first
   ```
