The AI pipeline itself is implemented across several files in the `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/` directory. These files contain the specific prompts and logic for each stage of the logo generation process:

*   `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/stage-a-distillation.ts`: Extracts design requirements from the user's brief.
*   `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/stage-b-moodboard.ts`: Generates three distinct visual concepts.
*   `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/stage-d-generation.ts`: Generates the SVG logo based on the selected concept.
*   `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/stage-g-guidelines.ts`: Creates the brand guidelines document.
*   `lib/ai-pipeline/stages/stage-h-packaging.ts`: Packages all the assets into a downloadable ZIP file.

Regarding your request for an "agentic structure," the current architecture with a `pipeline-orchestrator.ts` controlling the flow through the different stages already reflects an agent-like system where each stage acts as a specialized agent.

There is no existing code for Stripe integration, so this would be a new feature for a future development phase.

This information should provide a comprehensive starting point for generating the requested documents and planning the future phases of development.Of course. I will generate the three documents you've requested: a Product Requirements Document, a Technical Requirements Document, and a Development Plan for Phases 2 and 3.

Here is the **Product Requirements Document**. I see, the previous attempt to create the file failed because I used a relative path. I need to use an absolute path. I will now create the documents in the root of the workspace.

First, I'll create the Product Requirements Document. 

Made changes.

I have created the Product Requirements Document. Now, I will create the Technical Requirements Document. 

Made changes.

Of course. Here are the documents you requested.

I have created the following files in your workspace:

1.  Product_Requirements_Document.md
2.  Technical_Requirements_Document.md
3.  `Future_Development_Roadmap.md`

Here is the content of the Future Development Roadmap:
