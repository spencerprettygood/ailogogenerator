### Architecture Improvement Recommendations

1. **State Management Overhaul**:

   - **Issue**: Mix of React context and prop drilling for state management
   - **Recommendation**: Implement consistent state management with Zustand
   - **Timeline**: Q3 2025
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Animation System Architecture**:

   - **Issue**: Current animation implementation is basic and isolated
   - **Recommendation**: Implement dedicated animation system with standardized interfaces
   - **Timeline**: Q2-Q3 2025
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: Implementation planning complete

3. **Error Handling Consolidation**:

   - **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across components
   - **Recommendation**: Implement centralized error handling system with retry mechanisms
   - **Timeline**: Q3 2025
   - **Priority**: Medium

4. **Testing Coverage Expansion**:

   - **Issue**: Incomplete test coverage for UI components and animations
   - **Recommendation**: Expand test coverage with specific focus on animation components
   - **Timeline**: Ongoing
   - **Priority**: Medium

5. **Build Performance Optimization**:
   - **Issue**: Build times could be optimized further
   - **Recommendation**: Implement module/component lazy loading, optimize bundle size
   - **Timeline**: Q4 2025
   - **Priority**: Low
